Hello, this is a test. If the code works properly, then different images will appear in this video alongside some subtitles and audio. Otherwise, every image in this video will be the fallback image. This code works thanks to iCrawler, gTTS, pydubs, moviepy, and other free-to-use software. Shout out to anyone who is reading or listening to this and thank you for trying my program.
